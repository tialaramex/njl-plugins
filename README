These are LADSPA plugins, you also need at least one LADSPA host to make
use of this software. A description of each plugin is included in the file
PLUGINS, and a simple Makefile is included to build (but not yet install)
all of the plugins.

See http://www.ladspa.org/ and http://plugins.org.uk/ for more information
about LADSPA (the Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API) and for a
much broader variety of plugins.
